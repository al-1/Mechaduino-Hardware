here you can find the changes of this branch compared to the original.

I had some play around with the original eagle files. My goals was to changed them to use more part I do have in stock. In the last iteration I was also trying to get all components on one side.
This also not ready yet. I do not know. I do not know yet whether I ever will order modified board or just use the original.
